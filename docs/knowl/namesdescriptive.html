<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Descriptive File Names.</span></h4>
<p>File names should be descriptive! Furthermore, they should describe <em class="emphasis">what the file actually contains/is about</em> and not some random name. Probably most of your files are descriptive? That's great! But what's the catch? File names should also be short. Short, sweet, too the point, and also descriptive.</p>
<p>That's pretty tricky, you might say. Sure, I respond, but you can take advantage of abbreviations and word shortening tricks. For instance, suppose I had a file names like so: <blockquote class="blockquote">Chapters3_4_Overview of Sampling and Simple Random Sampling (SRS).pdf</blockquote> This is clearly descriptive. We know exactly what this PDF is about: it refers to chapters 3 and 4 of a textbook which is about sampling in general and digs into simple random sampling. But wow, it's really long. On my computer, it shows up as <blockquote class="blockquote">Chapters3_4_Overview of…SRS).pdf</blockquote> Now do you know what this file contains? I don't. Yes, it's on chapters 3 and 4 but we are left hanging as to what the chapters are an overview of! Moreover, what does the random “SRS” mean at the end?</p>
<p>If it were me, I would rather name this file (based on the conventions discussed so far) <blockquote class="blockquote">Ch3_4_Sampling and SRS.pdf</blockquote> Wow! So much shorter. Do you still have an idea of what the file contains? Hopefully! “Ch” is usually accepted as an abbreviation for “Chapter” so it is clear that this file is over chapters 3 and 4. The subject of these chapters is sampling and simple random sampling (“SRS” is a widely-used abbreviation in statistics for simple random sampling).</p>
<article class="assemblage assemblage-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">File Naming Trick.</span></h5>
<p>An easy way to shorten file names is to remove the vowels from words. The human brain is incredible in that it can determine what a word should be based on a small amount of context. Assuming the file above was in a folder pertaining to statistics, I could shorten it even more: <blockquote class="blockquote">Ch3_4_Smplng and SRS.pdf</blockquote> And we still know what it's about!</p>
<p>A quick word of caution. Take care not to over-abbreviate. It may not be necessary to abbreviate every word. For instance, I wouldn't change “you” to “y” or “gate” to “gt”. You may be confused later: does “gt” mean “gate”, “git”, “get”, “gut”, “agate”, etc., etc.?</p></article><p>Summary: keep your file names short and to the point. Describe what the file is (I wouldn't name the file above “bananas.pdf”!).</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="S_filenames.html#namesdescriptive" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

<div class="introduction"><p>It is time to put together what you learned in this section and make some edits of your own. Don't be afraid to look back at what we did earlier for reassurance. Start this exercise on the “Code” tab of your <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">aboutme</code> repo. The goal of this exercise is to add another section to the README file.</p></div>
<article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h5>
<p>Think about something about you that you have not put in the README yet. Perhaps your favorite food, quote, or historical character. Once you have chosen what you want to add, create a branch with an appropriate name.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<p>Edit your README file. You should have at the very least a new level two heading indicating what you are adding and a piece of text with your addition.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h5>

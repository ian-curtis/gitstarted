<p>Throughout this part, I will guide you through the process of editing with a team while providing warnings and lessons from what I have learned. I should say that the extent of my knowledge of this topic is not as developed as others' might be. With Git, I find it better to stick with the things I know how to do (add, commit, push, pull, fork, clone, etc.) and if a problem arises, I research how to fix it. As I learn how to correct Git errors, I will update this part of the book and especially <a href="app_gittroubles.html" class="internal" title="Appendix C: Common Git Troubles and How To Fix Them">Appendix C</a>. Regardless, the focus of this book is on the basics and what you need to know to have a successful workflow. If that's what you need, read on.</p>

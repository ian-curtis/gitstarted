<p>As more people collaborate on a project at the same time, the complexity of the branch and fork system increases. With this, it is important to consider potential conflicts. Especially with larger projects, you could have multiple working on the same area at the same time. If two people decide to change the same part of the project at the same time, who's edits win? Who gets the privilege of having their changes incorporated into <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">main</code>? Sadly, GitHub and Git cannot figure that out by themselves and create a merge conflict, leaving you, the repo moderator, to settle the dispute.</p>

<p>It is also important to keep your file names consistent. If I had another file about chapter 5 of this textbook which is about cluster sampling, let's say, I would want to name it something like <blockquote class="blockquote">ch5_clstr_smplng.pdf</blockquote> Notice that the structure is the same as before: first I have “ch5” to represent the chapter number, then I describe the chapter with “clstr_smplng”. Like before, I use snake_case and I made sure to use the same abbreviation for “sampling” as I did before. Consistency is key for our own sanity and so we can quickly scan for the file we need.</p>

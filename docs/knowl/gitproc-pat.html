<p>Click on your GitHub profile icon and navigate to Settings.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<p>Scroll down and click on “Developer Settings”.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h5>
<p>Click on “Personal access tokens”. This page will give you an overview of all the tokens you have created, their expiration dates, and the things they have access to.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h5>
<p>Click on “Generate new token”. Your GitHub password may be required.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(e)</span></h5>
<p>Enter a title for your token. What is your project? This name doesn't really matter; it exists solely to help you remember why you made it. If this is your first <abbr class="acronym">PAT</abbr>, perhaps name it “Git Started Work” or “About Me”.</p>
<p>If you choose the above, make sure you only use the token for that purpose!</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(f)</span></h5>
<p>Choose an expiration date. At what point do you plan on being done with this project? Set the date for a month after that. Don't fret too much about it; you can always create a new <abbr class="acronym">PAT</abbr> later for the same project. But I can bet that you won't want to do this process more than once for one project if you can help it.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(g)</span></h5>
<p>Select a scope or scopes. What do you want this <abbr class="acronym">PAT</abbr> to give you access to? This will depend on your project but less is better (for privacy in the event of hacking). Don't be super concerned as it is difficult to hack <abbr class="acronym">PAT</abbr>s. If you do not give a <abbr class="acronym">PAT</abbr> permission to do something, that something will not be able to be done locally, even by you.</p>
<p>For this project, you will want the “repo” scope and maybe the “user” scope. Once you have the scope(s) selected, click “Generate token”.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(h)</span></h5>
<p>You will get an email that a <abbr class="acronym">PAT</abbr> was created. Record your <abbr class="acronym">PAT</abbr> somewhere. You will never see it again after you close or refresh the page. Don't put it somewhere easily accessible. <em class="emphasis">Treat <abbr class="acronym">PAT</abbr>s like passwords.</em> They are confidential and should not be shared. When Git (on the command line) asks for your password, you will enter in your <abbr class="acronym">PAT</abbr> instead.</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_gitsetup.html#gitproc-pat" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

<div class="introduction">
<p>Suppose you work for Taylor Swift (wouldn't that be cool!). She is super busy right now recording albums, writing songs, spending time with family and friends, and making TikToks and needs your help. She has all of her songs saved on her computer in folders which are divided up by one album per folder. She has asked you to help her rename her folders so that she still knows what each folder is, but follows proper naming conventions. Use your knowledge from above to help Taylor out.</p>
<p>Following is a list of her current folder names:</p>
<ul class="disc cols2">
<li><p>Taylor Swift</p></li>
<li><p>Taylor Swift (Deluxe)</p></li>
<li><p>Live From Clear Channel Stripped 2008</p></li>
<li><p>Fearless</p></li>
<li><p>Fearless (Platinum Edition)</p></li>
<li><p>The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection</p></li>
<li><p>Speak Now</p></li>
<li><p>Speak Now (Deluxe Edition)</p></li>
<li><p>Speak Now World Tour Live</p></li>
<li><p>Red</p></li>
<li><p>Red (Deluxe Edition)</p></li>
<li><p>1989</p></li>
<li><p>1989 (Deluxe Edition)</p></li>
<li><p>reputation</p></li>
<li><p>Lover</p></li>
<li><p>folklore</p></li>
<li><p>folklore (deluxe edtion)</p></li>
<li><p>folklore: the long pond studio sessions (from the Disney+ special) [deluxe edition]</p></li>
<li><p>evermore</p></li>
<li><p>evermore (deluxe version)</p></li>
<li><p>Fearless (Taylor's Version)</p></li>
<li><p>Red (Taylor's Version)</p></li>
<li><p>Unreleased Music</p></li>
<li><p>Singles</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Wow! That's a lot of albums! Complete the following tasks to make Taylor's life a little easier for the future.</p>
<p>Please note that the answers to many of these exercises will vary depending on personal preferences. I will give answers depending on how I might approach the problem; they are certainly not the only answer you could have given.</p>

<article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h5>
<p>Before we trying fixing a problem, let's figure out what the problem is. What do you notice about these folder names? What about them is “incorrect”?</p>
<div class="solutions"><a href="" class="solution-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/solution-1-hidden.html" title="Solution 1.1.a.1"><span class="type">Solution</span><span class="period">.</span></a></div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<p>Ok, we've identified a problem. How can we go about deciding what to do about it? You may already have some ideas, but stick with me here. Let's not just dive in and start removing spaces and shortening folder names. Instead, let's make a plan.</p>
<p>Identify some naming patterns. Are there any album names that are similar? Can you form any groups of names?</p>
<div class="solutions"><a href="" class="solution-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/solution-2-hidden.html" title="Solution 1.1.b.1"><span class="type">Solution</span><span class="period">.</span></a></div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h5>
<p>I am going to continue with the groups in the solution to <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/taylorswiftgroups.html" title="Task 1.1.b">Task 1.1.b</a>. Feel free to branch off with your own groups or stick with me.</p>
<p>Now that we have groups, we can figure out how to name one of each group, then apply that naming style to all names in the group. Start with the standard albums, such as “Taylor Swift”. How can you change this name to stick with the conventions discussed above?</p>
<div class="solutions"><a href="" class="solution-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/solution-3-hidden.html" title="Solution 1.1.c.1"><span class="type">Solution</span><span class="period">.</span></a></div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h5>
<p>Apply the naming to scheme to all folders with “regular” album titles.</p>
<div class="solutions"><a href="" class="solution-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/solution-4-hidden.html" title="Solution 1.1.d.1"><span class="type">Solution</span><span class="period">.</span></a></div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(e)</span></h5>
<p>Continue with the deluxe group. Identify patterns, change one name, then apply those changes to all the names in the group. Use your best judgement, but don't stress about the “perfect” name.</p>
<div class="solutions"><a href="" class="solution-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/solution-5-hidden.html" title="Solution 1.1.e.1"><span class="type">Solution</span><span class="period">.</span></a></div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(f)</span></h5>
<p>Continue with the live group. Identify patterns, change one name, then apply those changes to all the names in the group. Use your best judgement, but don't stress about the “perfect” name.</p>
<div class="solutions"><a href="" class="solution-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/solution-6-hidden.html" title="Solution 1.1.f.1"><span class="type">Solution</span><span class="period">.</span></a></div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(g)</span></h5>
<p>Continue with the Taylor's Version group. Identify patterns, change one name, then apply those changes to all the names in the group. Use your best judgement, but don't stress about the “perfect” name.</p>
<div class="solutions"><a href="" class="solution-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/solution-7-hidden.html" title="Solution 1.1.g.1"><span class="type">Solution</span><span class="period">.</span></a></div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(h)</span></h5>
<p>Continue with the other group. Identify patterns, change one name, then apply those changes to all the names in the group. Use your best judgement, but don't stress about the “perfect” name.</p>
<div class="solutions"><a href="" class="solution-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/solution-8-hidden.html" title="Solution 1.1.h.1"><span class="type">Solution</span><span class="period">.</span></a></div></article><div class="conclusion"><p>I think that's all of them! That may have seemed like a lot of work but I hope it was worthwhile. It should now be much easier for Taylor to navigate her folders and quickly know that album they contain.</p></div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_filenames.html#taylorswiftfolders" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

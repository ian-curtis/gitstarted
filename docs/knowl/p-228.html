<p>Think of your computer like the forest. If I ask my computer to open a file called <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">poem.pdf</code>, how will it know where to look for that file? Like you in the forest, it wouldn't even know where to start. Likewise, what if I had two files named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">poem.pdf</code> in different folders? What if I had two files named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">poem.pdf</code> in the same folder? How would it know which one to grab? It wouldn't! It's like me telling you there are two identical chests of diamonds in the forest and I want you to bring me the one I am thinking about. But you don't know the one I am thinking about.</p>

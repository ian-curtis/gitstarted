<div class="introduction"><p>This method will first set up a remote to upstream, pull in changes from upstream, then push changes to origin.</p></div>
<article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h5>
<p>Head to your terminal and make sure you are navigated to your clone. Do a check to make sure you are on your main branch; if not, use <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git switch main</code>.</p>
<p>If you are planning on making more changes to a branch, but want it updated to the latest upstream changes, you can stay on a branch. If you have any uncommitted changes, you might make a merge conflict.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<div class="introduction">
<p>This step will only have to be done once per repo that you have forked, then cloned. When you clone a fork, the connection between origin and upstream is not carried over. If I tried to pull from upstream without this connection, I would get an error: <div class="code-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><pre class="console">fatal: 'upstream' does not appear to be a git repository
fatal: Coult not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
</pre></div></p>
<p>This is troublesome! Clearly upstream exists; how else would we have forked it? To fix this, you need to manually set the remote connection. Again, this only has to be done once per forked/cloned repo.</p>
</div>
<article class="task exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(i)</span></h6>
<p>Navigate to the authoritative repo's homepage and copy its <abbr class="initialism">HTTPS</abbr> clone link, just as if you were going to clone the repo.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(ii)</span></h6>
<p>Head back to your terminal and use <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git remote add upstream &lt;https-link-you-just-copied&gt;</code>. There will be no output.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(iii)</span></h6>
<p>Verify that it worked with <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git remote -v</code>. This will print out the HTTPS links for origin and upstream. Make sure your username is on the origin remotes and the official repo/username is on the upstream remotes.</p></article></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h5>
<p>Ok, that was the hardest part. Once again, this only has to be done once. After that, every time you want to pull from upstream and update local and origin, you just need two commands: <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git pull upstream main</code> and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git push origin main</code>.</p>
<p><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git pull</code> will fetch and merge upstream changes from its main branch and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git push</code> will take all of your files and push them to origin, updating them there.</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_gitcollabpr.html#try-git-pull-upstream" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

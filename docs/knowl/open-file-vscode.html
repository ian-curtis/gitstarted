<p>Try to open the README file with the terminal. (Remember how? See <a href="S_commands.html" class="internal" title="Section 2.3: Basic Commands">Section 2.3</a> if not.) What happened?</p>
<p>Any number of things could have happened. It might have worked and <abbr class="initialism">VS</abbr> Code opened with your file ready to edit. Maybe it didn't work at all and no applications opened. Maybe your terminal opened up a different app. The problem with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">open</code> command is that it picks the default application and opens that. For me, by default, all <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">.md</code> files open in RStudio. So, I have to specifically tell my terminal that I want <abbr class="initialism">VS</abbr> Code to open the file, not anything else.</p>
<p>Luckily, <abbr class="initialism">VS</abbr> Code has its own command! Remember how every Git command starts with <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git</code>? Well that same idea holds for many different commands. To open a file in <abbr class="initialism">VS</abbr> Code, type <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">code &lt;file-name-and-extension&gt;</code> where <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">code</code> stands for <abbr class="initialism">VS</abbr> Code. Now things should work correctly and <abbr class="initialism">VS</abbr> Code should open your file.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_gitedits.html#open-file-vscode" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

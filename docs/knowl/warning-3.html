<p><a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/try-git-pull.html" title="Git Procedure 4.10: Trying git pull">Git Procedure 4.10</a> demonstrates that your local repository and GitHub only communicate with each other when you tell them to. Any changes you make on GitHub will not be reflected on your computer unless you pull. Vice versa, any changes you make on your local computer will not be reflected on GitHub unles you push. Be careful with this. If you change a file locally <em class="emphasis">and</em> remotely on GitHub without pulling or pushing you might create a <dfn class="terminology">merge conflict</dfn>. These are best avoided. The simplest conflicts can be resolved somewhat easily but they can quickly get very complicated. See <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[provisional cross-reference: merge-conflicts]</code> for more information on this.</p>
<p>When working by yourself, merge conflicts are easier to avoid. Just make sure that you only edit at one place at a time (e.g. locally or remotely) then make sure both locations are up to date before editing in another place.</p>
<p>Small note for advanced users: as explained in <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[provisional cross-reference: merge-conflicts]</code>, you can edit in both locations at once <em class="emphasis">as long as you do not edit the same line</em>. Merge conflicts only arise when the same line(s) has been changed. So if I change lines 3 and 4 locally and 5 and 6 remotely, I can merge, pull, and push without any problems. But if I change line 7 in both locations … eek!</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_gitpr.html#warning-3" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

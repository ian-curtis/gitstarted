<p>Now that we are familiar with navigating our computer with the command line, let's learn a little more. Suppose you are in your Desktop (which we are) and you want to add a text file. Since you are already in the terminal, you don't want to open a text editor, create a new file, and save it to your desktop. Or, suppose you have a file on the Desktop that you no longer need and you don't to open you file browser, navigate to the Desktop, and delete the file. These examples may seem silly, but now suppose you are six folders deep. It would take much more time to navigate to those folders in a file browser than it would in the terminal.</p>

<p>Pull requests are only necessary when using branches (recall how when we edited the README file directly from the main branch we had no pull requests). We are currently in a situation that would require a pull request. How do we create one? First notice (on your GitHub repository for the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">animal</code> branch) how a new message has appeared. This probably says <blockquote class="blockquote">This branch is 1 commit ahead of main.</blockquote> This is GitHub's way of telling you that the branch you are currenlty on has changes that are not reflected on the main branch. Specifically, we have committed one time and the changes from that single commit do not appear on main. We could go and edit the README file some more and commit those changes. In that case, we would be 2 commits ahead of main.</p>

<p>This is actually pretty common. Maybe you are writing a book and your abandoned chapters were on GitHub for your editors to look at. Now that the book is published, you don't want those chapters online. Maybe you are using and API and when you were developing a project had your app's API connection keys available and not that the project is public you want to remove the file containing them.</p>

<p>Ok, we're making progress! Now that we are in the Desktop, what can we do? Let's use another terminal command to see what files and directories are currently on your Desktop. <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ls</code>, or <dfn class="terminology">list contents</dfn> will do the trick. Note that the output will differ for each user as we all have different files in different places.</p>

<p>Enter <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ls</code> into your terminal. What is the output? Is it what you expected?</p></article><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, your terminal should have just listed every single element on your Desktop. If you every forget what files are in your “active” directory (and you don't want to open your file browswer and navigate to the folder), use <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ls</code> as a refresher.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that some files/directories show up in your terminal that are not visible on your Desktop. This is because most operating systems by default hide certain files that should not be deleted. They still exist, they are just invisible to prevent accidental deletion.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="S_commands.html#ls" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

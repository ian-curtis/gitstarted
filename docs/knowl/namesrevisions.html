<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">File Names With Revisions.</span></h4>
<p>I'm willing to bet that most of us have been there: You write one draft, get feedback, save a second draft as a new file, get feedback again, and finally make a new file with a final draft. Then, you decide to make modifications to that final draft which is saved as a new file, etc., etc. This is great until you realize that now you have way too many files for a single document. How do you know which one is real final draft? What if you open the wrong one and start editing? Now you have to edit all of the files to make them match.</p>
<p>Sure, a computer can handle that many files and doesn't really care how many drafts or revisions you have. But more files take up more storage space and increases the chances of confusing you! How on earth can we solve this problem? It's not like there's a magic software that can keep track of all of our changes in a single file.</p>
<p>Ah, but there is! This magic software is called Git. Git specializes in <dfn class="terminology">revision control</dfn> which means that you do not have to worry about twelve drafts. Git keeps track of your revision history for you. If you are familiar with Google Docs, Git is very similar. Docs saves your changes and makes it easy to revert back to an old version if you change your mind on anything.</p>
<p>For now, don't worry about Git; we will get there in <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[provisional cross-reference: C_git]</code>. Just know that after reading this book, you won't have to worry about excess drafts and should never have to save so many drafts again.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="S_filenames.html#namesrevisions" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

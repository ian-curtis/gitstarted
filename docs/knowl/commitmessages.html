<p>It is up to you how to format your message. Some people write in complete sentences while others use incomplete sentences with capital letters. Some people use past tense, others present tense, and even others use present participles (add<em class="emphasis">ing</em>). I choose to use present tense with incomplete sentences and lowercase letters. But that's my preference. You should find what you like and stick with it.</p>
<p>…Except when you're editing someone else's files. In this case, pay attention to how someone else words their commit messages and imitate them. This will make life easier for the owner of the files and for anyone else who looks at the files in the future. You may even find that your commit message is changed by the owner of a repository to match their guidelines.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_hubbranches.html#commitmessages" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

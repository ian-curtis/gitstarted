<div class="code-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><pre class="console"><b>git push
</b>fatal: The current branch country has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin country
</pre></div>
<p>Well that looks a little scary. Fatal! That just means that git wansn't able to complete your request and stopped trying. The reason this failed is because the branch <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">country</code> is only on your computer, it hasn't yet made it to GitHub (which is what we are trying to do). It is possible to create a remote connection between branches but I often don't especially if I am only working on one branch at a time and if I plan on deleting a branch when I'm done with it. Should you want to create a remote, use the command Git provided.</p>

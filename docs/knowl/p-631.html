<p>We're almost done! At this point, you should have completed the three-step process as outlined in <a href="S_gitfinalize.html" class="internal" title="Section 4.3: Sending Changes Back To GitHub: The Three-Step Process">Section 4.3</a>. What could be known as the fourth step is to head back to GitHub and submit a pull request. At this point, it does seem silly to ask yourself for permission to include your own changes, but it makes more sense when contributing to someone elses repository. In order for your changes to be included into any main branch, you need to ask the repo owner/moderator(s) for permission to pull in your changes.</p>

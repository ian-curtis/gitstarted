<p>Remember committing from <a href="S_hubbranches.html" class="internal" title="Section 3.3: Working With Branches">Section 3.3</a>? This commit is the same concept as it was before: telling Git/GitHub that your changes are done, you are sure they are done, and that you would like them to be a part of your main, active branch. This is easy on GitHub; all we had to do was hit the “Commit changes” button. With Git and the command line, there are no buttons or fancy things to interact with. We instead have to tell Git exactly what we want to do.</p>

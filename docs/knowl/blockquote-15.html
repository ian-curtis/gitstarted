<p>It's not always feasible to edit file on GitHub, as we did in <a href="S_hubfirstrepo.html" class="internal" title="Section 3.2: The First Repository and File">Section 3.2</a> and <a href="S_hubbranches.html" class="internal" title="Section 3.3: Working With Branches">Section 3.3</a>. Certain text editors (for instance, Visual Studio Code which you might also have installed) have features built in to ease coding and file editing. <abbr class="initialism">VS</abbr> Code extensions might add color to text to help you see what's going on in your code. Others provide bug fixing and error catching before the errors actually occur. In general, you will edit files on your personal computer and will want to share them with the world. <em class="emphasis">I would stay away from editing on GitHub unless you have a small correction and/or you don't need any special editing tools.</em></p>

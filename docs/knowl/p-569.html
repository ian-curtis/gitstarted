<p>All files you currently have open appear as tabs at the top of your screen. You might also have noticed that when you saved your file, the name of your README changed from white to a cheddar color and an M appeared. <abbr class="initialism">VS</abbr> Code has Git integrated inside of it (one of the many benefits). As Git keeps track of your changes, <abbr class="initialism">VS</abbr> Code tells you which files you have <em class="emphasis">m</em>odified (M, yellow), <em class="emphasis">d</em>eleted (D, red), or created (U, <em class="emphasis">u</em>ntracked). If you were to undo <em class="emphasis">all</em> of your changes and saved the file again, the M would disappear and the color would go back to white.</p>

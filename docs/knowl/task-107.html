<p>This task is all about noticing. Take a minute to identify each of the following elements on the page. These will help you in the future to recognize that you are opening a pull request for someone else's repository and can be a reassurance that you are in the right place.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>The title of the repository has changed. You are no longer on your fork, but on the forked-from repo. As such, the Watch, Fork, and Star data have changed to describe that authoritative repo.</p></li>
<li>
<p>There is a dialog box indicated which branches are being merged. There are more boxes than before. There should be four, allowing you to specify which repo and branch to want to merge from and which repo and branch you want to merge to. Usually GitHub gets it right, but not always, so check to make sure these are what you want.</p>
<p>The <dfn class="terminology">base repository</dfn> is the repo you are merging to (the authoritative repo), the <dfn class="terminology">head repository</dfn> is the repo you are merging from (your fork). The base branch is the specific branch you are merging to (often <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">main</code>) and the compare branch is the branch from your fork you are merging from (often <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">main</code> for me personally).</p>
</li>
<li><p>After these boxes is, hopefully, a gree checkmark and an “Able to merge” message. This is what you want. You might also get a red message about conflicts or other messages. In this case, you might have a merge conflict and will need to do some extra work. See <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[provisional cross-reference: merge-conflicts]</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a summary of all the commits made on the branch (with their commit messages)</p></li>
<li><p>There is info on all of your specific changes in each file</p></li>

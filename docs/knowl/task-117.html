<div class="introduction">
<p>This step will only have to be done once per repo that you have forked, then cloned. When you clone a fork, the connection between origin and upstream is not carried over. If I tried to pull from upstream without this connection, I would get an error: <div class="code-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><pre class="console">fatal: 'upstream' does not appear to be a git repository
fatal: Coult not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
</pre></div></p>
<p>This is troublesome! Clearly upstream exists; how else would we have forked it? To fix this, you need to manually set the remote connection. Again, this only has to be done once per forked/cloned repo.</p>

<article class="task exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(i)</span></h6>
<p>Navigate to the authoritative repo's homepage and copy its <abbr class="initialism">HTTPS</abbr> clone link, just as if you were going to clone the repo.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(ii)</span></h6>
<p>Head back to your terminal and use <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git remote add upstream &lt;https-link-you-just-copied&gt;</code>. There will be no output.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(iii)</span></h6>
<p>Verify that it worked with <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git remote -v</code>. This will print out the HTTPS links for origin and upstream. Make sure your username is on the origin remotes and the official repo/username is on the upstream remotes.</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_gitcollabpr.html#task-117" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

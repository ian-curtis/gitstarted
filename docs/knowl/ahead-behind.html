<p>GitHub uses <dfn class="terminology">ahead</dfn> and <dfn class="terminology">behind</dfn> to tell you how your fork currently sits compared to the repo you forked from. Any commit that you have made to your fork that has not been merged into the parent repo ticks up the number of commits ahead you are. Any commit that has been made to the parent repo that is not reflected in your fork ticks up the number of commits behind you are.</p>
<p>As an example, you might have a message like “This branch is 2 commits ahead, 3 commits behind <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&lt;parent-repo&gt;:main</code>”. This means you have made 2 commits that are not on the parent repo and that the parent repo has 3 commits that you have not fetched.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_hubcollabfetch.html#ahead-behind" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

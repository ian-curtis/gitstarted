<p>Notice how in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-branch-poem.html" title="Figure 3.3.1.2">Figure 3.3.1.2</a> that the main branch does not move forward when branches are created, it stops once a branch is made. When you first create a new branch, all you have is a copy of the main branch. However, when you edit your new branch, the changes do not appear into the main branch. Branches are like testing grounds. Try some new things, see if you like them, see if they work, then make it official. “Making it official” with Git and Github is called <dfn class="terminology">committing</dfn> (as we have seen). Two new terms that go with commits<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-43-hidden.html" title="Footnote 43"><sup> 43 </sup></a> are <dfn class="terminology">merge</dfn> and <dfn class="terminology">pull request</dfn>. Oftentimes, you will hear people say that they just merged their changes into main. This means they committed their changes to the main branch and updated the official version.</p>

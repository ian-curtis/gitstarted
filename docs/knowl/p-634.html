<p>Hopefully you were given the “Pull request successfully merged and closed” message. From here, click on “Delete branch”. You should have no fear about deleting the branch at this point. Your changes will not be lost because you just incorporated them into main. You now have two identical copies of the same files and can get rid of the extraneous copy, your old branch. If it makes you feel better, GitHub keeps track of commits and merges. If you ever want to revert back to an old version, you can in <a href="S_hub_revert_commit.html" class="internal" title="Section C.5: Reverting To a Previous Commit">Section C.5</a>. Go back to the “Code” tab and verify that your favorite animal appears in main.</p>

<p>This will conveniently bring you right to the pull request page, which might look familiar. Your previous commit message will automatically be there. The only thing you really need to do is click on “Create pull request”. (But read below before you click it.)</p>
<p>Also take note at the top of this page GitHub tells you what branches are being merged. You will probably see <blockquote class="blockquote">
<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">base: main</code><span class="fas fa-arrow-left"></span><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">compare: &lt;your-branch-name&gt;</code>.</blockquote> This means that you are taking your branch and attempting to merge your changes into the main branch from the “base” repository, or <em class="emphasis">your repo</em>.</p>
<p>Like before, if you scroll down, you can see all of the changes you made. Later, I will be able to see this too, to make sure that you only changed what you were supposed to and didn't write anything R-rated.</p>
<p>Now you can create the pull request.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_hubcollabedit.html#task-104" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

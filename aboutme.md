# About Me

My name is **Ian Curtis** and I currently have two dogs, Sadie (a *goldendoodle*) and Finn (an aussiedoodle). My favorite hobby is probably reading but I also love playing instruments and recording music.

My favorite musical artist right now is Imagine Dragons. My favorite tracks of theirs are as follows:
1. Whatever It Takes
2. Bad Liar
3. Follow You
4. Radioactive
5. Warriors

## Oh Look, More Things About Me

One cool fact: I'm **left handed**. Another fact I think is cool about me is I have *four* younger siblings.
* Bon Jovi
* Madonna
* Céline Dion
* Def Leppard
* Taylor Swift
* Cécilia Cara

## Extra Credit

### My Favorite Colors

* Teal
  * This color is the perfect mix of blue and green that isn't ugly.
* Grey
  * It might seem bland, but it's the ultimate matching color. Every other color looks good with it and I respect that.
* Ruby Red
  * My first car was a ruby red and there is something unqiue about a good dark red that just works.

Note: I can use a random number generator in Python by importing the random module like so `import random`

### An Image

Below, I have put an image of my two dogs, Sadie and Finn. They are both begging for a treat.

### My Favorite Video

I think my current favorite video is [this Vsauce video on counting past infinity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrU9YDoXE88). It boggles my mind 
every time I watch it (and I've watched it many times).

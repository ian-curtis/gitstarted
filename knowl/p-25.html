<div class="para">The book is designed to be interactive where you follow along as you read; however, it is not a traditional textbook filled with exercises, definitions, and theorems. I am not testing you on any of this as I believe that Git and GitHub are skills best learned by doing, not through an exam. Feel free to make mistakes, break things, and revist chapters you forgot or didn’t understand completely. Answers to activities and exercises can be found in <a href="app_answers.html" class="internal" title="Appendix D: Answers to All Activities and Exercises">Appendix D</a>.</div>

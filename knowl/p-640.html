<div class="para">I would like to point out some helpful features that <abbr class="initialism">VS</abbr> Code has (other text editors will likely have these same features but not in the same places). In the bottom left corner, <abbr class="initialism">VS</abbr> Code displays the name of your current active branch. This is incredibly useful in case you forget what branch you are on (especially if you are working with multiple branches) or if you want to verify that you are working on a branch and not on main. <abbr class="initialism">VS</abbr> Code also displays (on the left side) a list of all of your files and directories that are inside your GitHub repository allowing easy access to any file you might wish to edit.</div>

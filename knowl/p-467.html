<div class="para">Click on the profile icon in the top right (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-hub-navbar.html" title="Figure 3.1.2.2">Figure 3.1.2.2</a>) and select “Settings”. Don't be scared of the long list of possible customizations that are available. Most are only applicable to experienced GitHub users. I will introduce the settings you may be interested in right now. The headings of the following paragraphs match up with the headings of the tabs on the GitHub page. Note that some tabs have been excluded as well as some settings within some tabs. This does not mean that they are not important; it just means that I don't think they are necessary for a beginner.</div>

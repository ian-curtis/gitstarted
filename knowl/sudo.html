It prompts you for your personal password and confirms your request to execute a command by checking a file, called sudoers, which the system administrator configures. Using the sudoers file, system administrators can give certain users or groups access to some or all commands without those users having to know the root password. It also logs all commands and arguments so there is a record of who used it for what, and when.</div></blockquote> <div class="para">This is a little too much for what is necessary here but has good information. Essentially, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">sudo</code> exists to allow you to run commands as an admin who, in some cases, might have more permissions to run certain commands. The benefit of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">sudo</code> is that your password is required.</div> <div class="para">So, if there is ever a command that involves risky business (such as permanently deleting files or folders) or if you ever want to purposefully add a layer of safety, use the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">sudo</code> command. The command is actually very simple: add the word <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">sudo</code> to the beginning of any terminal command and you will be required to enter your computer’s password before the command executes.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="S_advcommands.html#sudo" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

<p>Assuming you didn't click on anything, you should see a pretty empty page. In the top left, you should see your username and your repo name. This is common throughout GitHub so you always know where you are. Underneath that is a set of tabs that can be used to navigate through the repository-level settings and options (see <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-hub-repo-tabs.html" title="Figure 3.2.2.1">Figure 3.2.2.1</a>). You should currently be on the “Code” tab. As may be expected, this tab displays all of the files associated with the repo; it is the “home page” for every repository. You should see that a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">README.md</code> file shows up. Also notice that the contents of the README are displayed under the list of files. GitHub knows how important the READMEs are to explaining code that it automatically displays the contents of the file. Right now, ours is empty (except for the default title).</p>

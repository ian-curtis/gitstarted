<p>But we have no problems with ourselves. Our pull request has been created and is waiting for permission to be pulled into main. In some instances, you will have to wait for a repo owner to accept your pull request. However, you are the repo owner and can <dfn class="terminology">merge</dfn> the changes yourself. You can do this on the current screen. Find the green “Merge pull request” button. GitHub will give you the chance to edit the message if necessary. Since we have no changes to make, click on “Confirm merge”.</p>

<p>Hopefully you are able to see the power in this. In a more serious project, commiting too early could have much bigger ramifications. Suppose I am coding a new character for a video game and the character has to use vulgar language. In a simple workflow, I would create a branch called <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">vulgar</code> or <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">new_npc</code> with a sub-branch of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">language</code>. Then, I would incorporate my code on my branches. Once that was done, I would run my code to test that it worked. Then I would submit a pull request, requesting my boss to pull in my new changes into the official version of the game. They would likely take a look at my code and try it themselves before accepting the changes. But let's say I forgot to add in the censorship beep over the language. If I had just merged right into main, my mistake may have been missed and I could get in serious trouble. But since I worked on a branch, my forgetfulness can be caught before the changes get incorporated and there won't be any flustering to quickly revert changes or fix the error.</p>

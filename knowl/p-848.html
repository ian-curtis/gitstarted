<p>For nearly every edit we've made in this book, we've made a corresponding branch. This is no different. I hope you understand the importance of branches, even if you are working with yourself. Since my repository is public, anyone can edit the files there. Therefore, I will approve pull requests from anyone as I will assume they are working through this book. However, the task in this chapter will be exclusive to just those who are reading this book. There is file called <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">secret.txt</code> with no instructions or anything at all. Later on, you will be adding a line to this text file.</p>

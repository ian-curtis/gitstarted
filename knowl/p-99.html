<p>Suppose you work for Taylor Swift (wouldn't that be cool!). She is super busy right now recording albums, writing songs, spending time with family and friends, and making TikToks and needs your help. She has all of her songs saved on her computer in folders which are divided up by one album per folder. She has asked you to help her rename her folders so that she still knows what each folder is, but follows proper naming conventions. Use your knowledge from above to help Taylor out.</p>

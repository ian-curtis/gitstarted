This is why I hope you took the time to really think of a good username when created your account.</div> <div class="para">Ok fine. If you have just created your account, have no repositories, have done pretty much nothing on GitHub other than editng settings, AND are truly unhappy with your username, change it now. NOW. Then try not to do it again.</div> <div class="para">This tab will also let you delete your entire account. It is in red for a reason. I would highly recommend never deleting your account. Even if you are done with GitHub and don't plan on ever using it again, others can still benefit from your code. Obviously some exceptions could apply here but for most purposes, you probably shouldn't delete your account.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="S_hubnavigate.html#paragraphs-35" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

<div class="para">As you read, if anything starts to become too confusing or overwhelming, take a break. While a dedicated reader might be able to read this book and complete the activities in one day, it is not recommended to do so. There is quite a bit of new content here and too much at once will certainly lead to an information overload. So take your time, read carefully, and, again, don’t be afraid to reread parts of the book anytime you need a refresher on things. If you think that something deserves more attention and more explanation, feel free to open an issue on GitHub (don’t know how? see <a href="S_hubissues.html" class="internal" title="Section B.1: The Issues Tab">Section B.1</a>) and let me know.</div>

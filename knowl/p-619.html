<p>The magic of staging files, however, lets you choose which files you want to push back. Maybe I'm working on three files at once, but only two are ready to go back to GitHub. Maybe I'm writing a book and I want my editor to be able to see chapters 1-4 but not chapter 5 (which I'm currently working on). At any given time, you can decide which files you want to stage.</p>

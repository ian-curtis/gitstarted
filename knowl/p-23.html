<p>That being said, be aware that skipping chapters or sections may cause a disconnect between the book activities and your participation. Most sections have activities scattered throughout and some chapters even have a lengthy extensive activity at their ends and these activites build off of one another. Even if you want to skip chapters, it might be worth it to take the time to participate in these activities along the way. If you are unfamiliar with the content, be sure to follow along with the activities.</p>

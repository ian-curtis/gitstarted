<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">File Names With Dates.</span></h4>  <div class="para">Ok, this isnâ€™t entirely problematic. But I never understood why dates in file names had to be so specific. Having years makes sense, maybe months. But days? Times? Seconds? Once you start getting that specific with dates and times, you run into the same issue as in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/namesrevisions.html" title="Paragraphs: File Names With Revisions">File Names With Revisions</a>. Dates and times just make your file names incredibly long, hard to read, and hard to use in the command line. Please try to avoid dates, other than years, perhaps.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="S_filenames.html#namesdates" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

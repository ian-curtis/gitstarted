<div class="para">As you gain more experience with Git and GitHub, you may start wondering if there is a way to hide files from public view. Your project may come with files that are private to you/your company and are not necessary to share with everyone else. You also may have programs that generate files that are used by a second program and these intermediate files do not need to be shared. Whatever the circumstance, you can choose to block a file or folder from being tracked by Git.</div>

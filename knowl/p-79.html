<p>If it were me, I would rather name this file (based on the conventions discussed so far) <blockquote class="blockquote">Ch3_4_Sampling and SRS.pdf</blockquote> Wow! So much shorter. Do you still have an idea of what the file contains? Hopefully! “Ch” is usually accepted as an abbreviation for “Chapter” so it is clear that this file is over chapters 3 and 4. The subject of these chapters is sampling and simple random sampling (“SRS” is a widely-used abbreviation in statistics for simple random sampling).</p>

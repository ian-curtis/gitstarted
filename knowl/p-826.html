<p>In my opinion, you want to keep the least amount of commits behind. If you are working on someone else's work, you want to stay up to date. If some big change happens, you should make sure you have that change on your fork. Why? Well, you don't want to overwrite anything someone else just did. You also don't want to work on adding a new feature that is already incorporated. Maybe the new change helps you do your work better/faster. You also want to avoid potential merge conflicts because someone else changed the same files you are working on.</p>

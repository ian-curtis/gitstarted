<p>This happenes often in large projects (and even in smaller projects). You have a branch, you've been working all day editing and creating files, making sure things work. But now it's time to stage the files and you don't remember what files you've edited! You aren't even positive what the file names are. True, <abbr class="initialism">VS</abbr> Code color codes your edited files but you might have folders and subfolders throught your repository and don't really feel like searching through everything to record what files you changed and which of them you want to send to GitHub.</p>

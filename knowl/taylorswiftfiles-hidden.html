<p>We will focus on the folder that I renamed to be <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">speak-now-dlx</code>. A list of her current file names for these tracks follow. I should note that it is often helpful to prefix song names with their track position so that they stay in order when in a folder. We won't remove those numbers. Also, “.wav” indicates that the song is a WAV file (see <a href="S_fileextensions.html" class="internal" title="Section 1.2: File Extensions">Section 1.2</a> for more). We should not remove these either as this could result in file loss or corruption.</p>

<p>Like before, complete the following tasks to make Taylor's life a little easier for the future.</p>
<p>Again note that the answers to many of these exercises will vary depending on personal preferences. I will give answers depending on how I might approach the problem; these are not the only correct responses.</p>

<p>Before we trying fixing a problem, let's figure out what the problem is. What do you notice about these file names? What about them is “incorrect”?</p>
<div class="solutions"><a href="" class="solution-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/solution-9-hidden.html" title="Solution 1.2.a.1"><span class="type">Solution</span><span class="period">.</span></a></div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<p>Ok, we've identified a problem. How can we go about deciding what to do about it? You may already have some ideas, but stick with me here. Let's not just dive in and start removing spaces and shortening file names. Instead, let's make a plan.</p>
<p>Identify some naming patterns. Are there any track names that are similar? Can you form any groups of names?</p>
<div class="solutions"><a href="" class="solution-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/solution-10-hidden.html" title="Solution 1.2.b.1"><span class="type">Solution</span><span class="period">.</span></a></div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h5>
<p>I am going to continue with the groups in the solution to <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/taylorswiftgroups2.html" title="Task 1.2.b">Task 1.2.b</a>. Feel free to branch off with your own groups or stick with me.</p>
<p>Now that we have groups, we can figure out how to name one of each group, then apply that naming style to all names in the group. Start with the “regular” tracks. How can you change these names to stick with the conventions discussed above?</p>
<div class="solutions"><a href="" class="solution-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/solution-11-hidden.html" title="Solution 1.2.c.1"><span class="type">Solution</span><span class="period">.</span></a></div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h5>
<p>Apply the naming to scheme to all the acoustic tracks.</p>
<div class="solutions"><a href="" class="solution-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/solution-12-hidden.html" title="Solution 1.2.d.1"><span class="type">Solution</span><span class="period">.</span></a></div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(e)</span></h5>
<p>Apply the naming to scheme to all the last track.</p>
<div class="solutions"><a href="" class="solution-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/solution-13-hidden.html" title="Solution 1.2.e.1"><span class="type">Solution</span><span class="period">.</span></a></div></article><div class="conclusion"><p>And that's it! If you would like more practice, look up the track listing for her other albums and repeat this activity. It would be a great activity in consistency; for example, for the tracks on the Taylor's Version albums, you would want to use the same naming scheme as in the folders. For me, I would say <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">02_red_tv.wav</code> for “Red (Taylor's Version)” and to any acoustic tracks, I would append <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">_acoust</code>.</p></div></article></body>

<p>Let's consider one example to help understand the benefits of thinking in commits. Suppose I was working on a small video game and I was tasked with creating different worlds a character could visit. With commits in mind, I decide to break down the task into chunks: I will build one world at a time. When I am done with one world, I will commit. When I am done with another world, I will commit a second time. And so on.</p>

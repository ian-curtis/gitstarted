<div class="para">First, navigate to <a class="external" href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-33-hidden.html" title="Footnote 33"><sup> 33 </sup></a>. Any browser should work. Click on the “Sign Up” in the top right corner. A welome box should pop up. Follow the instructions to create an account:</div>

<div class="para">Choose a username. Attention! Choose your username carefully. <a class="external" href="https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html#username-advice" target="_blank">Jennifer Bryan</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-34-hidden.html" title="Footnote 34"><sup> 34 </sup></a> has some great tips for choosing a username. A few are reproduced here:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">Incorporate your actual name! People like to know who they're dealing with. Also makes your username easier for people to guess or remember.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Reuse your username from other contexts, e.g., Twitter or Slack. But, of course, someone with no GitHub activity will probably be squatting on that.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future [or current] boss.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Shorter is better than longer.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible. In some settings GitHub auto-completes or suggests usernames.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Make it timeless. Don't highlight your current university, employer, or place of residence, e.g. JennyFromTheBlock.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Avoid the use of upper vs. lower case to separate words. We highly recommend all lowercase. GitHub treats usernames in a case insensitive way, but using all lowercase is kinder to people doing downstream regular expression work with usernames, in various languages. A better strategy for word separation is to use a hyphen - or underscore _. [Again the ideas from <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/namesspaces.html" title="Paragraphs: File Names With Spaces">File Names With Spaces</a> come back.]</div></li>
<li><div class="para">I would like to add one note to her list: avoid gaming usernames. GitHub is a serious professional community and something like “Xx_sp1cyMU3TARD_xX” would not be appropriate.</div></li>
</ul>
<div class="para">While it is possible to change your username later, it is better to not fall back on that as that can cause complications. As an example, my username is “ian-curtis”. I would have preferred to have it without any spaces but that was taken. It is short, simple, timeless, and I do not feel bad sharing it with anyone. If you have a very common name, consider using hyphens and underscores or rearranging your name. I could have tried “curtisi” or “curtian” (which sounds like I'm an alien).</div>

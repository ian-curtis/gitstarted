<div class="para">I have accidentally caused a merge conflict with myself and with working on the same repository from two different computers and two different accounts. Oops! This is an easy fix because I made the conflict with myself so I know which version is the correct one. If this happens to you, Git might send you to an unfamiliar screen when you try to push or pull. Youâ€™ll know you have this case if your terminal asks you to type in a reason why the merge must happen or how the conflict is resolved. This typically happens when you try to merge from an upstream main into a local main that has active changes (so create branches!).</div>

<p>Remember that you just created a copy of my repository. You can make all the changes you want on your copy without asking for permisson from me. But as soon as you try to update my repo, you will have to submit a pull request. A fork is where you edit some things, try some things, and break some things before making a final product of whatever it is you were working on. Then send the changes over to the main repo!</p>

<div class="para">Now you can make as many changes and commits as you want before opening a pull request (this will change the message on the dialog box). You don’t even have to merge your changes into your fork’s main branch before opening a pull request. However, I usually choose to do so just so I know that all of my changes from my various branches are included where they are supposed to be. Feel free to continue making edits and/or commits to your entry in the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">aboutyou.md</code> file before continuing!</div>

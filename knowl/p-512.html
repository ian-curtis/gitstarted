<p>You will also often hear about pull requests. Recall how GitHub allows anyone to edit anyone else's code, but in order to change the official version, they have to ask for permission. The asking for permission is sending a pull request. You are asking the creator of the main branch their permission to pull in your changes. Don't worry too much about this now; we will cover it when we get to multi-person collaboration. You will see the term come up in this chapter however which is why I chose to introduce it here.</p>

<p>In order to make Git work, we need to set up a connection between your computer and your GitHub repo. From here on, I might refer to your personal files as your <dfn class="terminology">local files</dfn>. A file is typically considered “local” if it does not exist on GitHub (or anywhere else on the internet). It is local because only you have access to it. You will likely hear other people use this term and its derivatives (such as “editing locally”). Whenever it comes up, it refers to work/files/things on your computer and not online.</p>

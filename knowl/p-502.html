<p>It might be worth saying again just to make sure you've got it. Instead of there being one version for each new word you add, there is one version for each commit. Projects are typically broken up into tiny pieces. Each of these pieces would correspond to a commit. So if something goes wrong, you can revert back to a previous commit. We don't want commits to be for every word since it would take forever to find the commit you want to revert to. Conversely, we don't want commits to contain too many edits as that would require more work if we had to revert backwards.</p>

<p>The main thing that pops out to me are the spaces. Every multi-word folder name has a space. Secondly, some of the names are very long. Third, there is not much consistency. Some names are capitalized, others aren't. There are clearly deluxe versions of albums but some say “deluxe”, others say “deluxe version”, and even others say “deluxe edition”.</p>
<p>The three here are the main issues; you may have thought of others. Great! I'm sure they are good observations.</p>

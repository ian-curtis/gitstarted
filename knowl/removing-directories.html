</h5>
<p>Similar to <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/removing-files.html" title="Warning 2.3.3.2: Removing Files is Permanent">Warning 2.3.3.2</a>, removing directories is too easy. Notice again that the terminal provides no output or verification that the process was happening. Also notice that there was again no dialog box asking if we were really sure that we wanted to remove the directory.</p>
<p><em class="alert">Removing directories with the terminal is permanent.</em> There is no recycle bin for these files. There is no “undo” or “restore”. The terminal deletes and forgets. Use extreme caution when using <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">rmdir</code>; only remove what you are <em class="emphasis">absolutely sure</em> you need to remove. You will not get a second chance and your computer will not ask you for verification.</p>
<p>Note: you can add in an extra layer of security with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">sudo</code> command, which requires your computer's password to be entered.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_commands.html#removing-directories" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

<div class="para">Any repository you own will have the remote identifier of “origin”, for you. Any repo you do not own <em class="emphasis">and that you fork</em> will have the remote identifier of “upstream”. Remember that a remote is like a connection between repositories; it’s the definition of the link between them. When you fork a repo, you are creating a remote connection between the parent repo (upstream) and your newly-created fork (origin).

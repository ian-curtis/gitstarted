Like in <a href="S_hubcollabsetup.html" class="internal" title="Section 5.2: Getting Set Up To Collaborate">SectionÂ 5.2</a>, we need to fork the repository you would like to edit. Although it is possible to use Git to edit on a repository that has not been forked, you will find problems when you try to push your changes since you do not have write access to the repo.</div>

<div class="para">So what is GitHub? It is a website that allows us to share our files with the world and it widely used by the coding/programming community. With GitHub, any public code can be viewed by anyone. Each person is able to copy the code and mess with it on their own computer, all without the original being changed. But if someone wants to change the original, they can submit a request asking the owners to incorporate their changes. GitHub keeps track of all of this information and can also help with version control. If you make a big mistake, you can revert back to old versions and try again. GitHub works closely with Git (hence its name) and is a nice interface for many common Git functions.</div>

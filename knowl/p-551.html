<p>Git is difficult to wrap your head around partly because it's new and partly because it's scary. There are many things that could go wrong and that are difficult (but usually not impossible) to revert. But Git's power of version control is so important. The goal of this chapter is to help you get familiar with working with Git on the command line and how it interacts with GitHub.</p>

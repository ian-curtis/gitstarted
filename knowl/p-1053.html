<p>I have accidentally caused a merge conflict with myself and with working on the same repository from two different computers and two different accounts. Oops! This is an easy fix because I made the conflict with myself so I know which version is the correct one. If this happens to you, Git might send you to an unfamiliar screen when you try to push or pull. You'll know you have this case if your terminal asks you to type in a reason why the merge must happen or how the conflict is resolved. This typically happens when you try to merge from an upstream main into a local main that has active changes (so create branches!).</p>

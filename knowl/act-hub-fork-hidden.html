<body class="ignore-math"><article class="activity project-like"><div class="introduction"><p>This activity focuses on forking a repo and getting a new project started that we will carry throughout this chapter: editing a file on a repository I created.</p></div>
<article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h5>
<p>First, navigate to my <a class="external" href="https://github.com/ian-curtis/aboutme" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">aboutme</code> repository on GitHub</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-54-hidden.html" title="Footnote 54"><sup> 54 </sup></a>.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<p>Locate the “Fork” button in the top right corner.</p>
<p>Note the number next to it. This indicates the number of people who have forked a repo. This also applies to the Watch (people who receive notifications for the repo) and Star buttons. A good sense of how popular and how useful the contents of the repo are can be gained from looking at these numbers (where higher is better.)</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h5>
<p>Click on the Fork button. A new webpage will appear allowing you to rename your fork and add a description. I recommend keeping the same name as the parent repository, as GitHub suggests. This will make it easier to remember what the repo is for.</p>
<p>That being said, you cannot have two repos with the same name. If you have been following along with the book, you might already have a repository named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">aboutme</code>. In that case, you should choose a different name, but one that is close or similar to the parent repo's.</p>
<p>Click on the Create Fork button.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h5>
<p>After a few seconds, your own fork will appear! Take a look at the top left corner where the name of the repo is displayed. You should notice that your personal username and repo name are there. But underneath that, in smaller font, GitHub tells you the username and repo name from which you forked. This is useful for reminding yourself that you are working on a copy of a repository, not the authoritative one.</p></article></article></body>

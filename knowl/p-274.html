<div class="para">This situation necessitates file paths. Literally, they are the direct path through which the computer can find the exact file you are thinking of. You are basically telling the computer where the file is. Continuing the forest example, it’s as if I told you to enter the forest, take a right at the first tree with a triangle, turn left at the lake, and walk six steps past the boulder that looks like a watermelon. You’d know exactly how to get there and would always find the correct file.</div>

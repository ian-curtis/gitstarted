<p>Folder names should also follow all of the conventions above. This is a lot harder to get used to. I still feel like I'm breaking the Human Code of Folder Names everytime I ignore spaces and capital letters. We're taught in school to start every sentence with a capital letter and put spaces between words. For whatever reason, I'm fine with file names, but folder names just don't feel right.</p>
<p>But too bad for me! I name my folders according to the conventions anyways. And you should too.(As I mentioned earlier, I use snake_case for files and kebab-case for folders. I highly recommend you do as well; they are the two most popular cases.)</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="S_filenames.html#paragraphs-14" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

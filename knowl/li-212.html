<p>There is a dialog box indicating which branches are being merged. There are more boxes than before. There should be four, allowing you to specify which repo and branch to want to merge from and which repo and branch you want to merge to. Usually GitHub gets it right, but not always, so check to make sure these are what you want.</p>
<p>The <dfn class="terminology">base repository</dfn> is the repo you are merging to (here, the authoritative repo), the <dfn class="terminology">head repository</dfn> is the repo you are merging from (here, your fork). The base branch is the specific branch you are merging to (often <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">main</code>) and the compare branch is the branch from your fork you are merging from (often <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">main</code> for me personally).</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_hubcollabedit.html#li-212" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

<p>For instance, suppose I wanted to open the file we discussed earlier. On the command line, I would open the file like this (don't worry about the commands, just notice what it looks like): <blockquote class="blockquote"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">open 'Chapters3_4_Overview of Sampling and Simple Random Sampling (SRS).pdf'</code></blockquote> I could also do it like this: <blockquote class="blockquote"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">open Chapters3_4_Overview\ of\ Sampling\ and\ Simple\ Random\ Sampling\ (SRS).pdf</code></blockquote> First, notice how long these titles are. That's a lot to type! What you should really notice is that in the first example, the file is surrounded in quotes and in the second, there are a bunch of backslashes. For each file name with spaces, you have to either remember to enclose the entire name in quotes or to take the time to put a backslash before every space. It may not seem like too much of a hassle, but you will get annoyed with it pretty quickly. It also can cause setbacks inside code editors when you want to import or export files with spaces.</p>

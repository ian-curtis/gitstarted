<p>Here is where you can change your username. <em class="emphasis">I would strongly recommend against changing your username except in dire circumstances.</em> This could lead to broken links or, if someone claims your old username, links to the wrong repository. This is why I hope you took the time to really think of a good username when created your account.</p>
<p>Ok fine. If you have just created your account, have no repositories, have done pretty much nothing on GitHub other than editng settings, AND are truly unhappy with your username, change it now. NOW. Then try not to do it again.</p>
<p>This tab will also let you delete your entire account. It is in red for a reason. I would highly recommend never deleting your account. Even if you are done with GitHub and don't plan on ever using it again, others can still benefit from your code. Obviously some exceptions could apply here but for most purposes, you probably shouldn't delete your account.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="S_hubnavigate.html#paragraphs-30" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

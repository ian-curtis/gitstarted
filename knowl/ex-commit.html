<div class="para">Let's consider one example to help understand the benefits of thinking in commits. Suppose I was working on a small video game and I was tasked with creating different worlds a character could visit. With commits in mind, I decide to break down the task into chunks: I will build one world at a time. When I am done with one world, I will commit. When I am done with another world, I will commit a second time. And so on.</div>
<div class="para">This is different than creating a window in a building in the first world, then saving. Then creating two more windows and a door, then saving. Then adding some a tree and some flowers, then saving. We save much more often than we commit. But <em class="emphasis">we save using our computer and commit using Git/Gitub.</em> I would never save to Github or commit to my computer. Saving is light, commiting is heavy.</div>
<div class="para">That being said, do make sure to save your files! You want to save your progress on your computer, but there is no need to commit after each time you save.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_hubfirstrepo.html#ex-commit" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

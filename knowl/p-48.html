<div class="para">If you are already familiar with an editor or if you like a particular one, use it! However, I personally prefer <a class="external" href="https:/code.visualstudio.com/Download" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-12-hidden.html" title="Footnote 12"><sup> 12 </sup></a> which can be downloaded at the previous link. Throughout this book, I will refer to <abbr class="initialism">VS</abbr> Code with some guidelines on how to find certain features. Should you decide to use another editor, it is up to you to learn how to use it. If you are a beginner with Git and the command line, I would stick with <abbr class="initialism">VS</abbr> Code although as you gain experience you might think about switching to Sublime Text.</div>

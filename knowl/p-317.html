<p>The purpose of this activity is to demonstrate the importance of file extensions. When none are provided, your computer either has to guess what the file's contents are or simply cannot interpret the file and asks you for help. We would like to avoid computer confusion as much as possible. Common file extensions and their file types are listed in <a href="S_fileextensions.html" class="internal" title="Section 1.2: File Extensions">SectionÂ 1.2</a>.</p>

<p> Right now, we have only edited the file, but we haven't told Github that we wish to keep our edits. It's as if we edited a document, but never clicked save! But if you scroll down to the bottom of the page, you'll see that there is no “save” button. You should see a green “Commit changes” button, as in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-hub-commit.html" title="Figure 3.2.3.4">Figure 3.2.3.4</a>. This is important. Github uses <dfn class="terminology">commit</dfn> when indicating that you are about to officially upload your changes to your repo. This is your last change to change anything. When you think you are done, go ahead and commit your changes (commit directly to the main branch). Your changes should be represented. Navigate back to the Code tab to prepare for the next section.</p>

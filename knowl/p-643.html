<div class="para">Any number of things could have happened. It might have worked and <abbr class="initialism">VS</abbr> Code opened with your file ready to edit. Maybe it didnâ€™t work at all and no applications opened. Maybe your terminal opened up a different app. The problem with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">open</code> command is that it picks the default application and opens that. For me, by default, all <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">.md</code> files open in RStudio. So, I have to specifically tell my terminal that I want <abbr class="initialism">VS</abbr> Code to open the file, not anything else.</div>

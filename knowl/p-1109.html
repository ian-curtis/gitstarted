<p>This definitely happens! Perhaps you tried a few things and they didn't work so you want to pull from upstream or origin and start over. Maybe you corrected some typos and someone else beat you to it so you want to merge their corrections in and keep working. I could go on and on. It's not difficult at all to force Git to make this happen, just make sure this is what you want to do!</p>

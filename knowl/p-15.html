<p>Git is an incredibly powerful tool, but it does come with a learning curve. While there are text editors and interfaces out there that make using Git somewhat easier, I believe that it is best to learn the Git essentials the “harder” way. I hope that in doing so you will be able to better understand the steps in the Git process and that using the features in text editors will be easier. Rather than just memorizing how to use a text editor or the commands to enter, I take a more direct approach and show you Git on the command line to help you understand the process. Once you have that down, you can apply the same skills to a variety of different interfaces as you explore new software and resources.</p>

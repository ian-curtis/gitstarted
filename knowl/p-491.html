<div class="para">If you are thinking “Wait! I don't know the details of my project!” then you are not alone. The problem with this is that you have to decide what your repo is going to be about before you name it. I have definitely been victim to this and have made some rather stupid names that I should've made better. For right now, I will tell you what to name your repo. In the future, it might be best to start with a private repo and then change the name (if you need to) before you make it public. Otherwise, just be aware of the consequences should you change it at any other time.</div>

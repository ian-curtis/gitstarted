<div class="introduction">
<div class="para">This step will only have to be done once per repo that you have forked, then cloned. When you clone a fork, the connection between origin and upstream is not carried over. If I tried to pull from upstream without this connection, I would get an error:</div> <div class="code-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><pre class="console">fatal: 'upstream' does not appear to be a git repository
fatal: Coult not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
</pre></div> <div class="para">This is troublesome! Clearly upstream exists; how else would we have forked it? To fix this, you need to manually set the remote connection. Again, this only has to be done once per forked/cloned repo.</div>

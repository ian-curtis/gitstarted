<p>There are a few important points to remember when reading or finding a file path. The main goal from this section is that you understand how a file path is structured. Paths will come back later.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>File paths do not like spaces. Recall the lesson learned in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/namesspaces.html" title="Paragraphs: File Names With Spaces">File Names With Spaces</a>. To a computer spaces indicate that you are ending the file path and starting something new. Do not name folders or files you are planning on accessing with the command line with spaces.</p></li>
<li><p>When you want to enter a new folder, use a slash (forward or backward) to indicate that you are going further in the document tree.</p></li>
<li>
<p>File paths are unique; you cannot have one file path refer to two objects. This is why your computer will never let you have two files with the same name and extension in the same folder.</p>
<p>You can however have files with the same name in different folders. Since the file path is different, there are no issues with duplicate files.</p>
</li>
</ul>

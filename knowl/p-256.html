<div class="para">There are many different types of files. At the very basics, we have images, videos, documents, and songs, but there are so many more. Even within each of those categories, there are numerous types. You may be familiar with a PDF and a Word Document. Both of those could be classified as “documents”, but are interacted with very differently. Whether you are an advanced computer programmer or someone who uses a computer for every-day purposes, an understanding of file extensions is essential. <dfn class="terminology">File extensions</dfn> help us understand what type of file we are working with and give us an idea of how we can interact with that file. The following chunks give common (and some not so common) extensions for various categories. Refer back to this section often, espeically if you find yourself forgetting what a file is.</div>

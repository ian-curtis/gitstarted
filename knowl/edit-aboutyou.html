</h3>
<div class="introduction"><div class="para">When most people collaborate, they make a bunch of changes on their fork. Then, when the changes are ready, they send them over to the main repository. This activity focuses on the first part of that process, editing files on your own fork.</div></div>
<article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h4>
<div class="para">Click on the “edit” button (the pencil icon on the right side of the page)</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h4>
<div class="para">Follow the instructions on the file to add your own entry.</div> <blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="para">To contribute, add your name as a level two heading. This can be just your first name, just your last name, both, all names, initials, a name you like, etc. In a paragraph, type the month, year, and the country and/or state/province you are contributing from. If you feel like it, tell us something cool about you! (See my example.)</div> <div class="para">Responses will be moderated. No explicit content whatsoever will be accepted (keep things G rated please!).</div>
</blockquote></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h4>
<div class="para">Once you are done editing, scroll to the bottom of the page, to the Commit changes block. In the box that is autofilled with “Update aboutyou.md”, type a more informative commit message. A description is not necessary.</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h4>
<div class="para">Do not select the button that says “Commit directly to the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">main</code> branch”. It is always a good idea to create a branch when editing someone else’s work.</div> <div class="para">Select the button that allows you to create a new branch and type in a better branch name.</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(e)</span></h4>
<div class="para">Notice that the green button now says “propose changes” rather than “commit changes”. Again, this is because you do not have permission to commit changes to my repo, just propose them. Click on this button once you have changed the branch name.</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(f)</span></h4>
<div class="para">This will conveniently bring you right to the pull request page, which might look familiar. Your previous commit message will automatically be there. The only thing you really need to do is click on “Create pull request”. (But read below before you click it.)</div> <div class="para">Also take note at the top of this page GitHub tells you what branches are being merged. You will probably see</div> <blockquote class="blockquote"><div class="para">
<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">base: main</code> <span class="fas fa-arrow-left"></span> <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">compare: &lt;your-branch-name&gt;</code>.</div></blockquote> <div class="para">This means that you are taking your branch and attempting to merge your changes into the main branch from the “base” repository, or <em class="emphasis">your repo</em>.</div> <div class="para">Like before, if you scroll down, you can see all of the changes you made. Later, I will be able to see this too, to make sure that you only changed what you were supposed to and didn’t write anything R-rated.</div> <div class="para">Now you can create the pull request.</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(g)</span></h4>
<div class="para">Here, you are asking yourself for permission to merge into your fork. Hopefully you give yourself permission to do so. Click on “Merge pull request” and then “Confirm merge”. You may delete the branch if you’d like.</div></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_hubcollabedit.html#edit-aboutyou" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

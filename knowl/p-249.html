<p>Think about how you might go about this task. The forest is unexplored; we only know that the chest exists inside. Where will you look first? Where will you enter? How will you keep track of where you've been? If you find it, how will you get back? There are many issues preventing you from doing your task efficiently. Sure, you could get lucky and the chest might be only 50 feet from the edge. But maybe it's 3000 feet away (or more!).</p>

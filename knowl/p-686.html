<p>If your repository looks like nothing changed, never fear. There are a couple of ways to get to where we need to get. Either of the following will work so pick what you like best.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>When in the Code tab, click on the dropdown menu that currently has “main” selected. Click on your new branch title (“country”). A new box should pop up saying that this branch is 1 commit ahead of main. On the right of that box, click “contribute” and then “Open pull request”.</p></li>
<li><p>When in the Code tab, click on the branch icon that says “2 branches” (this is different from before…previously it only said one branch). This gives a list of all the branches. Find the “country” branch and click on “New pull request”</p></li>
<li><p>Navigate to the Pull requests tab. Click on the green button near the top right that says “New pull request”. Select the branch you want to pull into main from either the “Compare” drop-down menu at the top or the example comparisons table. Click “Create pull request”.</p></li>
</ol>

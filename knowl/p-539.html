<p>Nice, another new screen. This time notice how we have changed tabs. We are now in the “Pull requests” area, which should make sense. The pull requests page is for more than just accpeting pull requests. If someone else has contributed to your repo and has opened a pull request, you can start a conversation here. Suppose you have a question about someone's changes or think they should improve their addition before you approve it. You can say that here.</p>

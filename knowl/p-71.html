<p>The following chunks go through my opinions on file naming conventions. But that's what they are: opinions. Suggestions. Following them will make your life easier later on. But by all means, go ahead and ignore me and decide for yourself later if you want to make a change. I probably won't pop up in your home and check your file names. Try not to get too lost with these; an extensive example will be provided at the end of the section.</p>

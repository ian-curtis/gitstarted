<p>Regardless of the method you chose in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/git-pr-create.html" title="Task 4.9.c">Task 4.9.c</a> or if you had the automatic pop-up banner, you should be on the same screen. This might look familiar. Notice that your commit message you chose back in <a href="S_gitfinalize.html" class="internal" title="Section 4.3: Sending Changes Back To GitHub: The Three-Step Process">Section 4.3</a> appears here. You have the choice to add a further description.</p>
<p>Note the drop-down menus at the top of the page. With these, you can easily decide which branches you want to merge into and which branches you are merging from. You should only see two choices since we only have two branches but this will not always be the case (especially if you are merging from an origin to an upstream, see <a href="S_gitcollabpr.html" class="internal" title="Section 6.4: The Final Steps">Section 6.4</a>).</p>
<p>You can also scroll down and see all of the files that were changed and all of the changes. This is good to check that everything is as you expected. This also works to check that someone who is trying to contribute to your repo is not destroying your project.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_gitpr.html#git-pr-open" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

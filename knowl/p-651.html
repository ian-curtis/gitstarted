<p>There are two types of remotes: <dfn class="terminology">origin</dfn> and <dfn class="terminology">upstream</dfn>. Upstream remotes are not typically necessary when you are working with yourself and on your own repo. We will come back to them in <a href="S_hubcollabfetch.html#SS_upstream" class="internal" title="Subsection 5.4.2: Second, Upstream">Subsection 5.4.2</a>. To Git, “origin” is the repo that you have cloned. Throughout this section, we have been working with a repo titled <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">aboutme</code> that is located on GitHub. This GitHub version of the repo is “origin”. When we cloned, we made a copy of “origin” onto our computer and Git established a remote connection from the local computer to GitHub.</p>

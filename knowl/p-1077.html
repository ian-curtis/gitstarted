<div class="para">We all make mistakes, especially with Git. You don’t know how many times I have staged the wrong files or committed my changes before realizing I did something wrong. Of course, it’s best to try and avoid these issues becasue they can cause headaches and frustration. Plus there’s usually a little fear involved (did I just erase my edits?) as well as hesitation (Git only does what I tell it, so I have to make sure I do it right).

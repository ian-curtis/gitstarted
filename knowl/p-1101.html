<div class="para">If <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git stash pop</code> doesnâ€™t work, you may have a bigger problem on your hands. You will want to do a Google search if this is your case. This happened to me at one point and unfortunately I had to completely reset my local repository to what was appearing on GitHub. In such an extreme case, I even made a copy of some of my files with my edits before doing any resetting so I could easily add my changes back in.</div>

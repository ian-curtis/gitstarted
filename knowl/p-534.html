<p>Alright, so you've edited a file on a branch AND you are happy with your changes. Everything looks good and works well on the branch so you are ready to incorporate your changes into the official version of your project. This is called creating a <dfn class="terminology">pull request</dfn>. It may sound odd to call it a pull request when it seems like you are actually <em class="emphasis">pushing</em> your changes toward the main branch. However, often with pull requests when collaborating, you don't have permission to access the main branch of another repo, so you have to request that someone <em class="emphasis">pull</em> your changes into the main branch.</p>

<p>Whoa. I said a lot of stuff there. Lots of new words and things you don't know how to do. Don't worry, I'll guide you through it in this section. When you get a new project, you want to try and break it up into pieces. Each piece will have its own branch on the Github tree. For instance, the two poems that you wrote on scratch paper above were two branches off of the official poem. They each had the same first and third stanzas; only their second stanzas differed. See <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-branch-poem.html" title="Figure 3.3.1.2">FigureÂ 3.3.1.2</a> for a visualization of branches in this instance.</p>

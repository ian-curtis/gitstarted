<section class="paragraphs"><h1 class="heading"><span class="title">A Text Editor.</span></h1> <div class="para">In order to edit files as demonstrated in this book, you will need a text editor outside of the basic default editor. Any editor will work such as <a class="external" href="https://www.sublimetext.com/download" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a><a class="xref" id="fn-6" href="" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-6.html" title="Footnote 6"><sup> 6 </sup></a>.</div> <div class="para">If you are already familiar with an editor or if you like a particular one, use it! However, I personally prefer <a class="external" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download" target="_blank">Visual Studio (VS) Code</a><a class="xref" id="fn-7" href="" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-7.html" title="Footnote 7"><sup> 7 </sup></a> which can be downloaded at the previous link. Throughout this book, I will refer to <abbr class="initialism">VS</abbr> Code with some guidelines on how to find certain features. Should you decide to use another editor, it is up to you to learn how to use it. If you are a beginner with Git and the command line, I would stick with <abbr class="initialism">VS</abbr> Code although as you gain experience you might think about switching to Sublime Text.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="materials-windows.html#paragraphs-4" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

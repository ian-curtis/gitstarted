<p>Take care to notice the difference between committing and saving. Saving is easy. You can add a word, then save. Add a word, save. And so on. Think of commiting as adding a word, saving, <em class="emphasis">and closing the document</em>. Now everytime you want to add another word you have to open the entire document again, add the word, save, and close the document again. This system is put in place to help with version control. Instead of there being one version for each new word you add, there is one version for each commit. Each commit represents a stamp on the version control timeline. When coding, you save your files, but commit your changes. This will become more apparent when we work with Git and with multiple files.</p>

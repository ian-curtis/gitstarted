<div class="para">Whew, we made it! A new repo has just been created…aaaaand a lot of new buttons and options just appeared. A lot of new unfamiliar words and tabs. Please don’t give up here! I will go through all of the important aspects. Many of the pieces are not applicable to beginners and some will not be applicable until we start working with Git and GitHub together. In this section, I will only be explaining the key features and will slowly add in more as we learn more about GitHub.</div>

<p>This section will be very short. All you need to do is open <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">secret.txt</code> and type one line of whatever you want (G-rated of course). Literally could be anything. Just something random. Maybe the following will inspire you:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>“Tick tock” went the tick tock croc.</p></li>
<li><p>Have you ever tried ham and peanut butter?</p></li>
<li><p>The jalepeno, who was too hot, walked into the ocean to cool off and was eaten by a shark who became the first creature to breath fire underwater.</p></li>
<li><p>I recently tripped up the stairs.</p></li>
</ul>

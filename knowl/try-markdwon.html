<div class="introduction">
<p>Let's practice your markdown skills! Here, you will make the "aboutme" repo name true. Feel free to use the guidelines and sources above. You could also search online if you aren't sure how to do what you want to do. I have provided my (basic) example <a class="external" href="https://github.com/ian-curtis/gitstarted" target="_blank">in the repo for this book</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-42-hidden.html" title="Footnote 42"><sup> 42 </sup></a> (titled <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">README_aboutme.md</code>). But be creative! There aren't any “right” answers here.</p>
<p>Github is pretty cool in that it will show you realtime updates of what your Markdown file will look like after you're done typing. There is a “Preview” tab right above the first line of your README file (you are currently on “Edit file”). After each task below, check the preview to verify that what you typed worked as expected.</p>

<article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h5>
<p>Currently, the title of the README is the repo name. Change the title to a more human-readable one.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<p>In the first paragraph, type your name (or your username), how many pets you have, and your favorite hobby.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h5>
<p>In a second paragraph, type a sentence stating who your favorite music artist is. Then, make an ordered list of your favorite songs from that artist.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h5>
<p>Create a heading level two titled “Oh Look, More Things About Me”</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(e)</span></h5>
<p>In a third paragraph, write two sentences with two cool facts about you. These could be made up, no one will know! After those facts, create an unordered list of your favorite musical artists after the one in the second paragraph.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(f)</span></h5>
<p>Go back to the previous paragraphs and bold two words and italicize two words.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(g)</span></h5>
<p>Extra Credit: Add an image, a nested list of your favorite colors and why they are your favorite, a link to your favorite YouTube video, and, if you know a coding language, some code.</p></article><div class="conclusion"><p>Don't leave your file yet! There's one more thing left to do.</p></div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_hubfirstrepo.html#try-markdwon" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

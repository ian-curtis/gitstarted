<p>That's pretty tricky, you might say. Sure, I respond, but you can take advantage of abbreviations and word-shortening tricks. For instance, suppose I had a file name like this: <blockquote class="blockquote">Chapters3_4_Overview of Sampling and Simple Random Sampling (SRS).pdf</blockquote> This is clearly descriptive. We know exactly what this PDF is about: it refers to chapters 3 and 4 of a textbook which is about sampling in general and digs into simple random sampling. But wow, it's really long. On my computer, it shows up as <blockquote class="blockquote">Chapters3_4_Overview of…SRS).pdf</blockquote> Now do you know what this file contains? I don't. Yes, it's on chapters 3 and 4 but we are left hanging as to what the chapters are an overview of! Moreover, what does the random “SRS” mean at the end?</p>

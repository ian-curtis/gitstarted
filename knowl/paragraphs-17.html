This is a lot harder to get used to. I still feel like I'm breaking the Human Code of Folder Names everytime I ignore spaces and capital letters. For whatever reason, I'm fine with file names, but folder names just don't feel right.</div> <div class="para">But too bad for me! I name my folders according to the conventions anyways. And you should too. (As I mentioned earlier, I use snake_case for files and kebab-case for folders. You might consider doing so as well; they are the two most popular cases.)</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="S_filenames.html#paragraphs-17" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

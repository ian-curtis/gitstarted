<li><p>Take caution when naming branches. You should follow the same guidelines the were discussed with file and folder names in <a href="S_filenames.html" class="internal" title="Section 1.1: File and Folder Names">SectionÂ 1.1</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Branch names should be extremely descriptive in the shortest way possible. It is wise to break up your project into distinct chunks and assign one branch for each chunk.</p></li>
<li><p>It is very easy to get lost within branches. You can create sub-branches off of normal branches. You can delete branches or ignore them. I advise only creating the branches you need at the current moment. If sub-branches (i.e., sub-tasks) are something you are interested in working with, I would recommend keeping a picture of the relationship between branches.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you are done with a branch, delete it. Otherwise, it will clog up your branch list. You can always create it again.</p></li>

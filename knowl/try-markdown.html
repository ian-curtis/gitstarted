<div class="introduction">
<div class="para">Let’s practice your markdown skills! Here, you will make the "aboutme" repo name true. Feel free to use the guidelines and sources above. You could also search online if you aren’t sure how to do what you want to do. I have provided my (basic) example <a class="external" href="https://github.com/ian-curtis/gitstarted" target="_blank">in the repo for this book</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-46-hidden.html" title="Footnote 46"><sup> 46 </sup></a> (titled <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">README_aboutme.md</code> in the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">book-activities</code> folder). But be creative! There aren’t any “right” answers here.</div> <div class="para">Github is pretty cool in that it will show you realtime updates of what your Markdown file will look like after you’re done typing. There is a “Preview” tab right above the first line of your README file (you are currently on “Edit file”). After each task below, check the preview to verify that what you typed worked as expected.</div>
